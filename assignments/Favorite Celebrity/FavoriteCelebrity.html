                <p>Selena Marie Gomez was born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas.
                    American actress and singer who won legions of young fans as the winsome star of the Disney
                    television series Wizards of Waverly Place (2007-12) and as a pop vocalist.
                    Inspired by her mother, an amateur actress, Gomez tried out for a role on the PBS children s
                    television
                    series
                    Barney &
                    Friends and, as a result, appeared regularly on the program in 2002-04. After making her big-screen
                    debut in
                    the
                    family movie Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003), she auditioned for the Disney Channel, which eventually
                    led
                    to
                    a
                    guest spot on the TV series The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. In 2007 Gomez was cast as Alex Russo, a

                    anxiety
                    and depression.

                    various
                    artists, and produce content for her production company, July Moon Productions.

                    unique
                    challenges. Through her openness, she has become an inspiration to many, encouraging others to
                    prioritize
                    their wellbeing, seek help when needed, and embrace their own authenticity.

                    <h2>Rare Beauty</h2>
                </ins>

                <p>
                    Rare Beauty is a makeup brand founded by Selena Gomez with a mission to redefine beauty standards
                    and
                    empower individuals to embrace their uniqueness. Selena wanted to create a brand that goes beyond
                    just
                    selling makeup products; she wanted to create a community that celebrates self-acceptance, mental
                    health,
                    and inclusivity.

                    One of the standout aspects of Rare Beauty is its commitment to inclusivity. They offer a wide range
                    of
                    shades for their foundation, concealer, and other complexion products, ensuring that everyone can
                    find a
                    perfect match for their skin tone. This inclusivity extends to their marketing campaigns as well,
                    featuring
                    models of diverse backgrounds and body types.

                    What sets Rare Beauty apart is its focus on mental health. Selena Gomez has been open about her own
                    struggles with mental health, and she wanted to create a brand that supports and uplifts others who
                    may
                    be
                    going through similar challenges. Rare Beauty has partnered with various organizations to provide
                    resources
                    and support for mental health initiatives, and a portion of their sales goes towards these efforts.


                    What I personally love about Rare Beauty is their emphasis on the "no-makeup makeup" look. They
                    believe
                    in
                    enhancing your features rather than masking them, and their products are designed to provide a
                    natural,
                    effortless look. Whether you want a subtle glow or a more glam look, Rare Beauty has got you
                    covered.

                    <h4>A quick note from Selena Gomez, founder and creator of Rare Beauty.</h4>
                </em>
                <em>
                    <p>Mental health is personal for me. Figuring out how to manage my own mental health hasn't always
                        been
                        easy, but it&apos;s something I am constantly working on and I hope I can help others work on, too.

                        Sometimes, my highs are really high, and my lows can take me out for weeks at a time. When I
                        found
                        out I suffer from mental health issues, in many ways it was a relief because I could better
                        understand what&apos;s going on. I realized that there was a way to get help, and for me, that also
                        meant
                        finding the right treatments. Taking care of my mental health—just like my physical health—takes
                        work, but when I do, I am happier, I am healthier, and more in control of my emotions and
                        thoughts.
                        I wish more people talked about mental health when I was younger so I could have learned and
                        understood what was going on with my own health earlier on.

                        That&apos;s why I launched Rare Impact and the Rare Impact Fund. I hope by sharing my own story and
                        using
                        my brand and platform to talk about and connect more people to resources that support their
                        mental
                        health, I can encourage others to get the help they need and bring more mental health services
                        to
                        educational settings.</p>
